Signal Detection Theory (SDT) attempts to address this shortcoming of classical psychophysics. Rather than having a single value, the threshold, SDT provides two parameters -- d' (dee prime) and β d' is similar to idea of a threshold. A person who has a low threshold (and therefore is sensitive to the stimulus) will have a largish d' while a person who has a high threshold (and therefore is insensitive to the stimulus) will have a d' that is close to 0. That is, d' is a measure of how sensitive the person is and is usually driven by bottom-up concerns.

β is a measure of how willing a person is to say that the stimulus was present. If you are expecting an important phone call, you are more willing to say that your phone is vibrating. That is, β measures top-down processing. A conservative person requires much evidence that the signal is present before they are willing to say that the stimulus is present. Such a person will have a β that is larger than 1. A liberal person requires little evidence that the signal is present before they are willing to say that the stimulus is present. Such a person will have a β greater than or equal to 0 but less than 1. When β equals 1, the person is unbiased -- neither conservative nor liberal.
